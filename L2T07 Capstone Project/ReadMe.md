Developed a program that partialy met the below specifications:

* Capture information about new projects. If a project name is not provided
when the information is captured, name the project using the surname of
the customer. For example, a house being built by Mike Tyson would be
called "House Tyson." An apartment block owned by Jared Goldman would
be called "Apartment Goldman."
* Update information about existing projects. Information may need to be
adjusted at different stages throughout the lifecycle of a project. For
example, the deadline might change after a meeting with various
stakeholders.
* Finalise existing projects. When a project is finalised, the following should
happen:
* An invoice should be generated for the client. This invoice should
contain the customer’s contact details and the total amount that the
customer must still pay. This amount is calculated by subtracting the
total amount paid to date from the total fee for the project. If the
customer has already paid the full fee, an invoice should not be
generated.
* The project should be marked as “finalised” and the completion date
should be added. All the information about the project should be
added to a text file called CompletedProject.txt.
 * See a list of projects that still need to be completed.
 * See a list of projects that are past the due date.
 * Find and select a project by entering either the project number or project
   name.
