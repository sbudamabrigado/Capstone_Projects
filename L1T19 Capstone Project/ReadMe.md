In this task, a program was created for a small business that can
help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team.

This program will work with two text files, user.txt and tasks.txt.

* tasks.txt stores a list of all the tasks that the team is working on.
  Note that this text file already contains data about two tasks. The data for
  each task is stored on a separate line in the text file. Each line includes the following data about a task in this order:
 * The username of the person to whom the task is assigned.
 * The title of the task.
 * A description of the task.
 * The date that the task was assigned to the user.
 * The due date for the task.
 * Either a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ value that specifies if the task has been completed yet.

* user.txt stores the username and password for each user that has
permission to use the program (task_manager.py). Note that this text file
already contains one default user that has the username, "admin"
and the password, "adm1n". The username and password for each
user must be written to this file in the following format:
 * First, the username followed by a comma, a space and then the password.
 * One username and corresponding password per line.
